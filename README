= Leapfrog

Leapfrog has mainly 2 functions.
One is Migration support. Other is setting data support.

Usually enterprise system is recording who made or updated the data.
But tables has not created_by/updated_by columns on scaffold generate.

You append one line into a migration file




1.Installation

  Download and copy to vender/plugins folder.

  or

  script/plugin install git://kobayashi-tbn.github.com/leapfrog.git

Example
=======

Migration

  Add 't.users' to Migration file in self.up method.


    class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def self.up
        create_table :users do |t|
          t.string :name
          t.string :password
          t.string :email

          t.timestamps
          t.users     # add column 'created_by' and 'updated_by'
        end
      end

      def self.down
        drop_table :users
      end
    end


  If you want to add column after created tables,
  Then run script/generate migration add_users_to_todo
  and edit the migration file.(ex. Model name is Todo.)


    class AddUsersToTodo < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def self.up
        add_users :todos
      end

      def self.down
        remove_users :todos
      end
    end
